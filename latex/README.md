## VS-Code Remote Container Setup for LaTeX Projects

Anywhere you see the string `latex_project`, you can replace with the name of your project/repository.


### Features

* `Makefile` to hold build commands and other scripts for development - especially useful for pipelines
* **AWS CLI** If you use other cloud providers or need other CLIs you can add/replace - especially useful with make commands
